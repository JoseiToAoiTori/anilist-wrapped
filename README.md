AniList Year-In-Review tool...or it would be if I can finish it


All shitty ideas:

- Usual shit from all the other tools: Time watched, episodes/chapters and number of completed things. Favourite genres and tags but weigh by score AND watched. Rate Diversity of genres
- Show highest rated anime/manga as well.
- Show favourite least/favourite studios.
- Show anime both started AND completed.
- Show distribution of scores (completed only)
- Show format distribution
- Fastest/slowest drops
- Show most popular years
- % of seasonals vs new shows
- Hottest/coldest takes
- Comparison to previous year(s)
